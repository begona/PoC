# Restaurant-Analysis---YELP

This final course project of the Illinois University Data Mining specialization, I have been able to put into practice all the acquired knowledge during the last 6 months, through the different subjects or specialized taught fields. I would like to emphasize that this capstone was not only an exercise to consolidate concepts and acquire practical skills on specific tools, but has also allowed me to globally understand the kind of problems I may face with data mining, how powerful is text mining, and how it allows us understanding any scenario or context, where digital conversations take place, and how we can build systems to analyze all types of digital context and extract relevant information that helps people in their daily decisions.

The project targets to analyze a restaurant recommendations data set to extract relevant information, used to build specific functionalities that could be included in a supposed recommender system, and would help users to make decisions about choosing a kind of cuisine, dishes, restaurants, even building a predictive system to anticipate whether a specific restaurant would pass or not a health inspection. For this, they provide us with a real data set from the YELP social network that contains 1,125,458.00 global reviews plus all the information this network collects from its restaurants and users.
In this report, I detail all the steps I have followed for the data mining, specially focusing on the comments or reviews mining, modeling or building the new recommendation functionalities specific engines. The main addressed challenges I have faced in each section, the developed strategies and the achieved results are summarized as follows.

Point out, in concerns to a more technical aspect, that I have perform the entire project with R, with the purpose of exploring the different packages implemented state of art in this language state.
